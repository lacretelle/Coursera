Percolation data type. 
To model a percolation system, create a data type Percolation with the following API
public class Percolation {

    // creates n-by-n grid, with all sites initially blocked
    public Percolation(int n)

    // opens the site (row, col) if it is not open already
    public void open(int row, int col)

    // is the site (row, col) open?
    public boolean isOpen(int row, int col)

    // is the site (row, col) full?
    public boolean isFull(int row, int col)

    // returns the number of open sites
    public int numberOfOpenSites()

    // does the system percolate?
    public boolean percolates()

    // test client (optional)
    public static void main(String[] args)
}

Monte Carlo simulation. To estimate the percolation threshold, consider the following computational experiment:

Initialize all sites to be blocked.
Repeat the following until the system percolates:
Choose a site uniformly at random among all blocked sites.
Open the site.
The fraction of sites that are opened when the system percolates provides an estimate of the percolation threshold.

public class PercolationStats {

    // perform independent trials on an n-by-n grid
    public PercolationStats(int n, int trials)

    // sample mean of percolation threshold
    public double mean()

    // sample standard deviation of percolation threshold
    public double stddev()

    // low endpoint of 95% confidence interval
    public double confidenceLo()

    // high endpoint of 95% confidence interval
    public double confidenceHi()

   // test client (see below)
   public static void main(String[] args)

}
